A language with a built-in dictionary type with a specified order of elements. The order of elements in the dictionary is determined at the time of its creation - the constructor of the dictionary takes a function that specifies the order in which elements should be inserted. Basic operations on the dictionary are possible (adding, removing, searching for elements by key, checking if a given key is in the dictionary, etc.), iterating over elements, and executing LINQ-style queries on the dictionary.
